# Excel in Astro

This is an Excel lookalike application made in Astro using both React and Vue.

It includes it's own shared state management between React and Vue components using a simple Observer Listener pattern

To run the application all you need to do is run:

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

or you could visit the page where it's hosted:

It's made entirely by me and the idea was given to me by my professor
